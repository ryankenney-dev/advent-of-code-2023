# Added Day 2 Part 1

I only submitted a single request to ChatGPT 4 for this one:

    Given this Go interface:

    type Algorithm interface {
        Title() string
        Compute(input string) string
    }

    ... where:

    * Title describes the meaning of the resulting numberic value
    * Compute executes the main algorithm and returns a string in the format "<Title>: <Resulting Number>"

    Solve the following Advent of Code problem as a Go library that implements the inteface. Name the resulting class "Day2Part1".
